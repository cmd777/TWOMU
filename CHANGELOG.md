## [Workflows]
- Now `msbuild` builds TWOMUHook
- The built dll is now included in the zip file (to inject it, just press 1, the same option that is used to find offsets within TWOM - this will be changed later to a custom option)

## [ImGui]

- Partially implemented ImGui (only the demo window is shown.)
- Added solution files, they can be found in the `TWOMUHook` directory (note: compiling only works with the x64 version.)
